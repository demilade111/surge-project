            <div class="section-content">
                <p>I’m not the best podcaster in the world, but I’ve produced nearly 250 episodes of <br>one show and
                    about 85 of another over
                    the past four-ish years.</p>
                <p>I’m not the best writer in the world, but I’ve published a few dozen books, penned a <br> blog for
                    eleven years, and engaged
                    in a variety of other writing-focused projects <br>over the course of the past decade</p>
                <p>There’s something to be said for the pursuit of mastery, but there’s also something<br> to be said
                    for repetition,
                    consistency, and just showing up, over and over and over <br>again, across a span of time.</p>
                <p>Most ideal, of course, is engaging in intentional practice, setting goals, learning <br>from
                    mistakes, and nudging ourselves
                    ever-so-much-closer to more masterful <br>performance, daily.</p>
                <p>But the “daily” component is important in its own right. Habit and persistence are <br>valuable in
                    isolation, in addition to
                    being arguably necessary for the pursuit of <br>higher levels of skill and achievement.</p>
                <p>Also important, though, is the capacity to stop when warranted.</p>
                <p>It’s valuable to be able to habitualize elements of skills you want to learn, but it’s <br>also
                    valuable to be able to set
                    aside habits when they’re no longer serving you, and <br>to know the difference between “this is
                    difficult, so I don’t want
                    to do it anymore”<br> and “this is no longer useful to me and I’d like to reallocate my time and
                    energy to<br>something else.”</p>
                <p>Facing frictions is part of the learning process: if everything is easy, you’re probably <br>not
                    growing</p>
                <p>There are times where those frictions simply aren’t worth the gains they might<br> bring, though, and
                    being able to
                    recognize those moments for what they are,<br> and being able to cleanly segue from one set of
                    habits and routines to
                    another, <br>is an exercise in self-discipline, self-analysis, and emotional management. It’s not
                    <br>always psychologically
                    simple to leave familiar patterns behind in the pursuit of<br> other, less-developed and
                    less-comfortable patterns, but it’s
                    vital to growth and <br>fulfillment.</p>
                <p>It’s not just important to be able to run—it’s important to know how to stop,<br> perhaps suddenly,
                    without injuring
                    yourself.</p>
                <p>It’s not just important to be able to establish and maintain habits—it’s important to <br>know when
                    it’s time to rearrange
                    or replace those habits, how to best do so, and how <br>to figure out what comes next.</p>
